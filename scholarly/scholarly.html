      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <div>
        This report presents the GUDBOI application, which was created as a 2024 HCI Project at FII UAIC.

    <section id="introducere">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In today's world, due to work and lack of time, dog lovers face several issues:
        inability to pay close attention to their pets, forgetting regular check-ups,
        morning rush causing feeding issues, lack of training knowledge etc.
    
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUDBOI app proposes an innovative new method of pet management, including
        notifications, automatic feeding, health tracking and training courses, 
        ensuring proper nutrition, tracking and increasing the overall life quality
        of users' beloved dogs.
      </p>

    <section id="scopul-aplicatiei">
      <h3>1.1 App purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the app is making pet ownership and home training easier and 
        easing the added stress of surpise issues owners tend to encounter when missing 
        the subtle signs their dogs are showing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="public-tinta">
      <h3>1.2 Target audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience consists of working dog owners who wish to keep track of their 
        dogs' health(vet appointments, appetite), training, trick knowledge and feeding
        (portion sizes, feeding time) much easier.
        
      </p>
    </section>

   
    <section id="descriere-generala">
      <h2>2. Functionalities</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="training">
      <h3>2.1 Training</h3>
      <p>
        The training functionality allows the user to keep track of their dog's 
        abilities and trick knowledge. For each of the training seessions, the app offers
        step by step tried and true training methods in order to teach the pet in the most 
        efficient way.
        The app also offers a <b>record</b> option in order to be able to watch the pet's progress later on.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="feeding">
      <h3>2.2 Feeding </h3>
      <p>
        The feeding functionality works based on user input of their dog's:
        <ul>
          <li>breed</li>
          <li>weight</li>
          <li>age</li>
          <li>food type</li>
          <li>feeding times</li>
        </ul> 
        Based on these, the automatic feeder that the app connects to will dispense
        the recommended amount of food at the pre determined feeding times. The integrated
        scale will also be able to determine the amound of food the pet has eaten and keep
        records of that in the dog's profile.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="doctor">
      <h3>2.3 Veterinary</h3>
      <p>
        This functionality will allow users to:
        <ul>
          <li>Keep track of regular vet check-ups</li>
          <li>Receive notifications if their dog appetite is abnormal</li>
          <li>Receive notifications in case a vet visit is recommended</li>
          <li>Keep track of the dog's medical records</li>
          <li>Keep track of the dog's prescriptions</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="descriere-generala">
      <h2>3. Interaction design patterns</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="wizard">
      <h3>3.1 Wizard</h3>
      <p>
        The wizard design pattern refers to processes alowing users to input information.
        In this case, the steps represent the instructions that the user
       picks to train their dog. After the selection is made, the app offers specific
       information regarding the training: videos, progress, instructions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="notifications">
      <h3>3.2 Acheivements </h3>
      <p>
        This design pattern refers to engaging users and convincing them to use the app 
        more in order to gather the recognition. In the GUD BOI app, this is done by tracking
        the evolution of each skill the dog has learned.
        
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="device-integration">
      <h3>3.3 Need-for-closure</h3>
      <p>
        This pattern prompts users to use the app in order to be done with what seems like 
        unfinished business. This is done by sending reminders for "training time" and for finishing
        a training course, as well as with the visual progression of each training in the trainingpage.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="#design-decisions">
      <h2>4. Design decisions</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="mobile">
      <h3>4.1 Mobile </h3>
      <p>
        Regarding the mobile design of the app, it allows the most freedom out of the 2 platforms
        where it is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the platform where most of the active interaction with the app is happening. The user
        is able to do multiple actions, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Input data about their dog</li>
          <li>Record the training sessions via the phone camera</li>
          <li>Keep and see the medical records of the animal</li>
          <li>Keep track of the dog's prescriptions</li>
          <li>Record training sessions</li>
          <li>View past training sessions</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="smartwatch">
      <h3>4.2 Smartwatch </h3>
      <p>
        Regarding the watch design of the app, it acts as a extension that makes the main mobile app
        easier to use. Due to the size of the screen, the icons and elements of the app have to be as 
        simple as possible, to avoid accidental clicking of something other than intended. The commands 
        consist of push buttons in order to be able to use them with ease even when in a rush. The only 
        exceptions are the sliding screens for picking the functionality and for picking the training.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform allows the user to continue the phone actions without needing to keep the phone on
        hand at all times. These actions include:
        <ul>
          <li>Receiving notifications</li>
          <li>Selecting the desired training session you want to start</li>
          <li>Starting/stoping the training session</li>
          <li>Sending treat thorugh the automatic feeder</li>
          <li>Viewing automatic feeder live camera</li>
          <li>Real time feedback about training command success</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
    </section>
