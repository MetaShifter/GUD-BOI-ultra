          <p>
            Scenario 1: Before her morning routine begins, Amelia uses the GUD
            BOI app for a focused training session with Max. Today, they're
            working on "heel" commands. The app's AR feature overlays guidance
            directly into their living room, showing Amelia how to adjust Max's
            position for optimal learning. As they practice, the app records
            Max's responsiveness, providing instant feedback that helps Amelia
            correct her technique on the fly. This technology makes each session
            more effective, enabling Max to master commands faster than ever
            before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scenario 2: During a weekend, Amelia decides to review her dog's
            health card on the GUD BOI app and realizes it's time for a vaccine
            update. She uses the app to schedule an appointment with her
            veterinary clinic directly, without having to switch between
            multiple platforms.

            experiences.
